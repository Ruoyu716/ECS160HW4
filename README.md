11/28/2019 First commit. 
Note: Need debugging, more cases test, errors handle, double check with Struct array and pointer.

11/29/2019 Second commit.
Note: try to fix struct array and expand it in c, but still not sure if using malloc and realloc correctly.

11/29/2019 Third commit.
Note: Work well with test, test1, test2, test3, test4, test5 and empty.csv. But when .csv file satrts with name, it does not work.
Also need to check white space and maximum line size, need to figure out removing outter quotes when print message.
